    "Hello! Daily homework today; similar to daily homework that was due Tuesday: Generate 100 samples from your loc = 10 model. Then, evaluate the likelihoods for this generated data for the following normal models: loc = 10, loc = 11, loc = 12. Remember, best likelihood is closest to zero (highest) sum of logs of probabilities. Which model is most likely by this score? Which is least likely? Is it what you expect?"
